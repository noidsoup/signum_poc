Today, Exegy is the premier provider of Direct Market Data feed solutions to Tier 1 firms – both buy-side and sell-side. We have a proven track record of innovation, amassing an Intellectual Property portfolio of over 117 patents and delivering in 2008 the first FPGA-based ticker plant to the capital markets. We also have a deep commitment to a premium user experience whereby we insulate our clients from the complexity of cutting-edge technology and deliver all of its value as a fully managed service. As we observe the rapid advance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) technology, we recognize that the future of low-latency trading infrastructure is delivering predictive signals in the same latency profile as normalizing, aggregating, and filtering market data. This vision has shaped our Signum offering, and we are striving to deliver it with our trademark commitment to innovation, performance, and service."

        value: "We have launched Signum for the United States equity markets, with expansion to other asset classes and geographies in the near future. Our current signals deliver predictions of price movements and forecasts of liquidity with every change in the National Best Bid and Offer (NBBO) across all 14 protected equity markets in the United States. Exegy Ticker Plant appliances process over 3 billion pieces of market data a day for each of our clients consuming direct and SIP feeds for US equities. Over 500 million of these pieces of market data alter the NBBO quote for a listed equity. Historically, the Exegy Ticker Plant consumes the data from all the feeds, normalizes the data to a common data model, then aggregates, filters and distributes the data to client trading servers according to each application’s directions via the Exegy API. Exegy completes the processing of each piece of market data in 5 microseconds using a single appliance that only consumes two rack units (2U) of space in your data center."
