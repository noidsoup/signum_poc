question: "What is the signal generation latency of Signum?"
answer:
  - nodeType: "paragraph"
    content:
      - nodeType: "text"
        value: "Signum signal generators are embedded in Exegy hardware-accelerated appliances. These appliances are purpose-built for low latency processing of market data. The additional latency imposed by adding Signum signals to each market data update event is approximately one microsecond. As always, Exegy engineers and data scientists are striving to optimize our signal models to drive the latency as close to zero as possible. Incremental performance improvements are delivered as part of our managed service."
