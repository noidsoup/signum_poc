answer:
  - data: {}
    content:
      - data: {}
        marks: []
        value: "Our goal is to make Signum such a compelling value that it becomes a “no brainer” purchase. Signum subscribers pay a flat monthly fee for each asset class and region of use. We have priced Signum to cost approximately 10x less than it would cost you to develop yourself. (We would also point out that Signum is available NOW – saving you over two years of development work and the risk that you may not achieve the same results.) We keep the Signum subscription fee fixed regardless of how many applications use the signal or where those applications are located."
