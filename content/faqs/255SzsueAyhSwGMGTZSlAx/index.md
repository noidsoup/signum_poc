question: "Why should we use Signum when we are already developing signals in-house?"

        value: "We view the Signum portfolio of signals as foundational. Our intention is to deliver useful signals (as a service) that can be integrated into novel and more profitable trading strategies. We expect Signum to be attractive to firms who are already investing in signal development, including machine learning and artificial intelligence. Signum offers an opportunity to accelerate the progress of those efforts by integrating proven signals and focusing internal teams on new signals targeted to specific trading strategies. If you are focused on the same types of signals as those that are already in the Signum portfolio, we invite you to compare the quality of our signals. Our hope is that you find ours just as good (or better) and choose to focus your efforts on novel ways of using Signum signals."
