question: "What do you mean by real-time signals?"
answer:
  - data: {}
    content:
      - data: {}
        marks: []
        value: "We mean that the signals are delivered synchronously with normalized market data. For example, when you receive a quote event with an update to the best bid and offer prices and sizes, you also receive predictions on when those prices will change (Quote Fuse), what direction the prices will move when they change (Quote Vector), and whether or not there is additional hidden liquidity at the displayed price (Liquidity Lamp). New signal values are delivered with EVERY market data update event."
