        value: "Signum is designed to allow each trading application to choose signal parameters on a per-symbol basis. Specifically, applications choose the probability values (or “accuracy thresholds”) upon which to take action. This allows applications to tune signal accuracy and triggering frequencies to meet specific trading goals. Registered users gain access to interactive charts that report accuracy, triggering frequency, and other signal performance metrics for selectable accuracy threshold values."
