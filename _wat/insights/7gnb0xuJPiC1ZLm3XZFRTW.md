While there is wide variance in the level of adoption of real-time trading signals and machine learning technology among our clients, they generally fall into two categories – those considering internal development of similar signals and those maintaining similar signals that were internally developed. Beginning with the former, we quantify the significant benefits of the Signals-as-a-Service solution delivered by Signum. We are pleased to say that many of our clients have recognized these benefits are incorporating our signals into the trading strategies and execution algorithms."
