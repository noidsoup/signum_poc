# Getting Started

## Install Hugo
The Signum website is built with Hugo, so before you do anything you'll want to [install it](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/). You'll need the Extended version, since we're using SASS.

## Make a .env file

```
CONTENTFUL_SPACE = {Your Contentful space ID}
CONTENTFUL_TOKEN = {Your Contentful API token}
```

## Install dependencies and run

```
npm i
```
```
npm start
```
